\# Roadmap



\## Near-term (pre-interview)

\- Add a small evaluation script (mAP for detection, IoU for segmentation) on a labelled sample set

\- Expose confidence/IoU thresholds and image size via CLI args

\- Add quick smoke tests and linting (CI)



\## Medium-term

\- Add error analysis notebook (false positives/negatives, class confusion)

\- Add batch inference support and performance notes (CPU vs GPU)

\- Add dataset loader template for custom datasets



\## Nice-to-have

\- Export results as COCO-style JSON

\- Add ONNX/TensorRT export notes for deployment
